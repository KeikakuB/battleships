Rather than everybody needing to learn a little bit of everything, we can focus are efforts on our specific roles and by doing so function better as a team and build a higher quality game by the end of next semester.

Below are the different Masteries/"Jobs" and Tasks that I've initially thought of (please feel free to add/tweak/delete them as you see fit) that will help us stay focused and organized. 

To be clear, we will all be responsible for programming/implementing whatever needs to be done. However, the Masteries you've chosen will somewhat change what you'll be working on and when. 

For example, by the time the game has been developed enough to warrant implementing a graphical system, the Graphics Master will need to have familiarized himself with SDL, designed/implemented a working prototype, guide the team's work and answer any questions regarding SDL.

- Tasks
    - UI Sketch + Demo: Bill
    - Requirements Document: Ben
    - Design Document: Franz
    - Acceptance Test: Ben, Bill, Franz

- Masteries
    - Requirements/Testing Master: Ben
        - Foreman: Must set the overall project pace and individual tasks.
            - Decide who will work on what, when to start and when it should be done.
        - Tester: Must ensure our design and implementation respect the project's requirements.
            - If the cruiser is supposed to have a cannon range of X and Y (as per the informal project requirements) then our game needs to implement it in such a way.
            - Ships aren't supposed to pass through Coral reef tiles. If they do the Requirements Master will be responsible for fixing it.
    - Network Master: Ben, Franz
        - Network Guru: Must be familiar with basic networking and SDL_net library.
        - Messenger: Must design and implement networking within the game.
    - Graphics Master: Bill
        - Graphical Guru: Must be familiar with SDL and able to answer any questions regarding it. 
        - Spriter: Must act as the lead graphical system developer and guide the development of the graphical system.
    - ...?
